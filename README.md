# Single Product Sliders For WooCommerce

This applet is a solution to a problem we had when wanting to offer a "social signals" service to our clients.
 
The slider allows the user to specify how many social signals they want to target for each URL and that is then stored in the back end on the order notes.

This was achieved by manipulating a single product (The social slider) and overriding any default "add to cart" buttons on the page and re writing the functionality of that in the back end.

## Features

- Slider and price calculation dynamically, discounts were applied to bulk automatically.
- Full validation for duplicates, non URLs etc.
- Fully hooks with Woocommerce to safely process the payment of the altered single product.
- Shows what URLs you have currently added to your order and the quantity of signals to send, you can also remove them as you please.
- Mobile friendly, the applet tells the user to turn their phone landscape (See the demo videos below)

## Further Notes
- Built using ES6, JQuery and PHP
- All testing was done by myself in order to prevent exploits and losses for the company.
